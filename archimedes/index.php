          <p>LG TACTICS is a strategy-lite battle card game where you must outmaneuver your opponent to win. It features simple gameplay where you decide which cards to deploy and attack with.</p>
          <p>The game is played with a single deck of cards and you can learn the rules in minutes. Players need to Recruit, Deploy and Attack with their cards until only one army remains. You can play against one or more opponents, or even play solo to test your skills. Games take about 15 minutes per person, and 1 - 5 people can play (more if you combine 2 decks).</p>
          <img class="right-img" src="img/tactics-psd-art3.jpg" width="960" height="540" alt="LG TACTICS - strategy battle card game"/>
          <p>Game cards feature a single number representing its power level. Some powerful cards have a deploy requirement in order to play onto the battlefield.</p>
          <p>TACTICS comes with 72 cards and a rule book in a game box. Cards feature original illustrations in a minimal fantasy silhouette style.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Overwhelm your enemies.</p></li>
  <li><p><strong>To win the round, deploy cards onto the battlefield that add up to 11 or more AND are all the SAME COLOR</strong>.</p></li>
  <li><p>The moment you have cards on the table that are the same color and add up to 11 or more you win the round.</p></li>
  <li><p> First player to win 3 rounds, wins the game.</p></li>
</ul>

<br/><hr>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>Shuffle the deck and deal 3 cards to each player. Place remaining deck in center and take turns around the table. Discard cards face up in a pile next to the deck.</p>

<br/><hr>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<img class="right-img" src="img/tactics-psd-table3.jpg" width="960" height="540" alt="LG TACTICS - strategy battle card game"/>

<h3>ON YOUR TURN do these 3 steps:</h3>
<p><strong>1. RECRUIT - Pick up 3 cards</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Underdog : Pick up another card if you have the least number of cards on the battlefield. Ties do not count.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. DEPLOY - Play up to 3 cards onto the battlefield.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><p>On your turn you can play up to 3 cards onto the battlefield. You can play almost any card in your hand, but certain cards have deploy requirements.</p></li>
  <li><p>If a card has a deploy requirement, you must have the required card(s) on the battlefield to deploy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. ATTACK - Attack with up to 3 cards.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Cards cannot attack during the turn they are deployed.</p></li>
<li><p>An individual card can only attack once per turn.</p></li>
<li><p>When two cards battle during an attack, the lowest valued card is discarded and the largest valued card remains.</p></li>
<li><p>If the cards have the same value, both are discarded.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple cards can attack a single card to defeat it. For example, a 2 and a 2 can attack a 3 and all cards will be discarded.</p></li>
<li><p>You can attack multiple players and multiple cards during the same turn.</p></li>
<li><p>If the deck runs out of cards, shuffle the discard pile and use it as the new deck.</p></li>
</ul>
<br/><hr>
<h3>Table setup</h3>
<img class="right-img" src="img/tactics-how-to-play2.jpg" width="449" height="593" alt="LG TACTICS - strategy battle card game"/>
<p>Cards cannot attack the turn they are deployed. You can use this double row method to help remember which cards can and cannot attack.</p>
<br/><hr>
<h3>Alternative gameplay (Fast)</h3>
<p>For a faster and easier game, Recruit, Deploy and Attack with 2 cards instead of 3. To win, you need cards on the battlefield of matching color that add up to 7 instead of 11.</p>
<br/><hr>
<h3>Solo Gameplay</h3>
<p>For Solo Gameplay you will be trying to create as many same colored stacks of 11 as you can before the deck runs out.</p>
<p>Play the game as you normally would but do this during your turn:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>To start your turn pick up 3 cards like you normally would. Take note of the color and number of the 3rd card you pick up. This card represents an attack against you.</p></li>
<li><p>You must discard a card on the battlefield with the same number and color as that card.</p></li>
<li><p>For example: If the card is a Red 3, you must discard a Red 3 that you have on the battlefield.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don't have a Red 3 on the battlefield, then you look for a Red 2 to discard.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don't have a Red 2 on the battlefield, then you look for a Red 1 to discard.</p></li>
<li><p>If you don't have any Reds at all, then you don't have to discard anything (phew).</p></li>
<li><p>And if you only have a Red 4 on the battlefield, then you don't have to discard anything as well.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This essentially acts as an attack on your cards, slowly chipping away at your advances.</p>
<p>When the deck runs out, you deploy all the possible cards in your hand. After you have deployed all possible cards, count the number of 11-stacks you have created. Check the scores below to see how well you did.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>6 or less - Weak sauce</p></li>
<li><p>7 - Could do better</p></li>
<li><p>8 - Almost there</p></li>
<li><p>9 stacks (max) - LG TACTICS SOLO GENIUS. nice work.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And that's a variation on gameplay that lets you play solo. Also a nice way to organize your cards by color. </p>
<h3>Solo Gameplay Video (10 min)</h3>
<p>Some of you have asked how solo gameplay works so I put together this video to show you. It covers setup, goal overview, gameplay, and win conditions. Many of the concepts and rules in this video carry over to the multi-player version of the game, so this can give insight to that as well.</p>

<h3>Card details</h3>

<p>There are only 4 points of interest on each card.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Power</strong> - The big number is the power level of the card. The higher the number, the stronger the card.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Name</strong> - The name is at the top of the card.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Color</strong> - At the bottom of the card is the color with identifying icon.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deploy Requirement</strong> - Some cards, in order to be deployed, require other card(s) to be on the battlefield. For example, in order to deploy a card that requires another blue card, YOU MUST HAVE A BLUE CARD on the battlefield when you deploy.</p></li>
</ul>
