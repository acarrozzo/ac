<p><strong>SS4ST</strong> is my solo music project. I like to create random tunes here and there for fun. I have finally compiled over 40 instrumentals into 3 albums and have them up on Spotify, iTunes, Amazon Music, and more. Enjoy.</p>

			<p>I have been involved with music in one way or another for pretty much my whole life. My uncle was in a band and he would always be playing the guitar at holidays and I thought it was so cool. When I was a kid he showed me how to play the opening riff to 'My Girl' and I was hooked ever since. </p>

			</figure>
			<p>I was lucky enough to take guitar as a class for all 4 years of high school as well as 2 years of music theory. During that time I would jam with friends during and after school and I also played bass at church every Sunday. I was very fortunate to have daily experience.</p>

			<p>In college I would play and record with a new group of friends, and in my late 20's I was playing bass with some really talented individuals in Banned from the Zoo.</p>

			<p>I have way too many guitars, like 3 basses, two ukes, a banjo, and a midi keyboard for recording. I try to play a little something every day. I also have phases where I really get into music production and create instrumentals and beats that feature strings, synths and all sorts of strange sounds. I generally use Garage Band and Logic. Feel free to give a listen.</p>
