			<p>I have been involved with music in one way or another for pretty much my whole life. My uncle was in a band and he would always be playing the guitar at holidays and I thought it was so cool. When I was a kid he showed me how to play the opening riff to 'My Girl' and I was hooked ever since. </p>

			<p>I was lucky enough to take guitar as a class for all 4 years of high school as well as 2 years of music theory. During that time I would jam with friends during and after school and I also played bass at church every Sunday. I was very fortunate to have daily experience.</p>

			<p>In college I would play and record with a new group of friends, and in my late 20's I was the bass player for Banned from the Zoo.</p>

			<p>I have way too many guitars, like 3 basses, two ukes, a banjo, and a midi keyboard for recording. I try to play a little something every day. I also have phases where I really get into music production and create instrumentals and beats that feature strings, synths and all sorts of strange sounds. I generally use Garage Band or Logic. Feel free to give a listen.</p>
