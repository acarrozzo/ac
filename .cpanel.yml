  tasks:
# Next line defines a DEPLOYPATH with the path to the document root of your website so that you will not have to enter it in each command manually:
    - export DEPLOYPATH=/home/acarlprf/acworld

# This line copies the index.php file to deploy path - the document root of your website:
    - cp index.php $DEPLOYPATH

Here are some more examples of how to deploy various files and folders:

#Copy the specific file to the destination from root:
#    - cp <file_name> $DEPLOYPATH

#copy the specific file from source subfolder:
#    - cp ./<sub_folder>/<file_name> $DEPLOYPATH

#copy all from the root (note that this command will not copy hidden files or folders located in the root folder, such as ".git" or ".htaccess"):
#    - cp -r * $DEPLOYPATH

#copy all from sub folder root:
#    - cp -r ./<sub_folder> $DEPLOYPATH
